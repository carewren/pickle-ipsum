# pickle-ipsum
The Rick and Mortyâ€“themed lorem ipsum generator.

## Inspiration
Adult Swim's cult-favorite show, *Rick and Morty*, is an ideal subject for lorem ipsum. Much of the show's scripts are workshopped in an improv fashion, and one guy voices most of the main characters (including Rick and Morty), which means that the show has the feel of a monologue for long stretches. And given the bizarre, non sequitor nature of the storylines, the entire show could sometimes be mistaken for wacky, R-rated lorem ipsum set loose in a cartoon multiverse.

This ipsum generator is named after an episode in which Rich turns himself into a pickle in order to skip family therapy, declaring "I'm pickle Riiiick!"
